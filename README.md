This is the repo for our Data Science group project in the Finance domain area. We have created a bubble Portfolio using Log-Periodic Power Law Singularity (LPPLS) Model.

Tactical Asset Allocation (TAA): What Is It? An active management portfolio technique known as tactical asset allocation changes the percentage of assets held in different categories to profit from anomalies in market pricing or robust market sectors. By taking advantage of particular market conditions, this method enables portfolio managers to add value. As soon as they achieve the intended short-term profits, managers return to the portfolio's original asset mix, making it a moderately active strategy.
